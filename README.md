# Harmona: Health Data Harmonization

## About
This repo is a MVP for Harmona, a harmonization tool to combine wearable data for physician interpretation during primary care check-ups. PCP in the US is an example of "snapshot" health - using snapshots (very short periods of time) of a person's heath. Think a 90s blood pressure reading or a brief check of respiration. These snapshots tell a wildly incomplete story. Wearables provide high-quality longitudinal data, but that data is in siloes. Someone's cardiovascular and respiratory data from their WHOOP is in one platform, their metabolic data from their CGM is in another, and their skeletal data from their Withings scale lives in a third. This data is far less impactful without the context of the other. Harmona harmonizes this data to make it more easily interpretable by the user and their physician. This supercharges physicians with deep, longitudinal context on their patient, improving the care experience for all involved.
